## History of Vision

It was now known that around 543 millions years ago, the evolution of the organisms in earth began. Large and vast species of evaluations happened in next short 10 millions years. There is an interesting hypothesis now for the case of this event, it is that around such time, the organisms start to evolve eyes. With eyes, they got vision, and they start moving in directions where there is food. And such, evolution began.


## The start of Everything, Camera

The advance in modern vision start from the camera, at first, most cameras are pinhole cameras, the below list these cameras:
1. Gemma Frisius, 1545
2. Encyclopedia, 18 Century
3. Leonardo Da Vinci, 16 Century

Nowadays, almost everyone get a cellphone and these cell phones are providing image data every day. So, the dataset available these days are much more compared to the older one. Modern Cameras can also get images of high resolutions and this also Challenge the computation power of the processor.


## Breakthrough in Biologists

It is now known that around 50% of neurons in human brain are involved in visual system. The famous experiment, [Hubel and Wiesel](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1359523/pdf/jphysiol01247-0121.pdf) done in 1959, demostrated that a cat's brain responds to the stimuli by activating specific neurons in the brain.


## First Computer Vision Paper
The very first computer vision paper came at 1963 by Larry Roberts.

1. Block World, Larry Roberts, *1963*
2. Generalized Cylinder, *1973*
3. Pictorial Structure, *1973*
4. David Lowe (Edge World), *1987*


## Problems To Tackle in Computer Vision
The very famous computer vision project at the 1966, called the summer projects, which main goal is to make an AI that could have vision just like human could. It is still quite a challenging task for nowadays, let alone that time, have no computational power and data. They failed and came the first AI winter. The computer vision now, mostly focus on one features and increasing the accuracy for that feature.
The basic problems in computer vision are:
1. Image Segmentation (Shi, Jinbo, Mailk, *1997*)[Graph Theory]
2. Face Detection (Voila & Jones, *2001*)[Adaboost]
3. "SIFT" & Object Detection (David, 1999)
4. Spatial Pyramid Matching
5. Histogram of Gradients (HoG) (2006)
6. Deformable part model (2009)


## Publish Datasets for Pushing Computer Vision to beyond.
The publish datasets help researchers to benchmark their models and gain publish datasets with ease. Modern deep learning models requires large amount of datasets to train. And such, quality labelled datasets are like the fuel for the model. The famous datasets include:
1. MNIST Dataset (Handwritten digits)
2. PASCAL Visual Object Challenge
3. ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognitions Challenge


## Evolution of Image Classification Algorithms
The very top algorithms for computer vision is Convolutional Neural Networks, where it use convolutions layers as the neural layers to extract the image information. The very first breakthrough in Computer Vision using deep learning is at 2012, where AlexNet was introduced in ImageNet Challenge. But, AlexNet was not done in overnight. Before AlexNet, there is already a CNN model built similar to AlexNet, in 1998, LeCun introduced a model but not achieved best accuracy because of the hardware and lack of dataset.
